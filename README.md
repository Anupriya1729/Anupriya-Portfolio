This is a Web based resume. Made by using HTML, CSS, Java Script.
I made it to understand how Github Pages work.
It uses 'Formspree', it is a form backend, API and email service for HTML forms.
I have used this in the contact me form.
The mails send using it reaches directly to my Gmail without revealing my Gmmil ID to the users.
# This repo is a good demonstration of how to place your files in order to use Github pages.
